Adsorption is accompanied by a decrease in entropy of the system but the enthalpy change can be either positive or negative depending on the nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent.\n\n[B] The critical temperatures of ethane and nitrogen are $563 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $126 \\mathrm{~K}$, respectively. The adsorption of ethane will be more than that of nitrogen on the same amount of activated charcoal at a given temperature - This statement is correct. The adsorption of a gas on a solid surface depends on the critical temperature of the gas and the temperature of the system. The gas with a higher critical temperature is adsorbed more readily at a given temperature. Since the critical temperature of ethane is higher than that of nitrogen, ethane will be adsorbed more readily on activated charcoal at a given temperature.\n\n[C] Cloud is an emulsion type of colloid in which liquid is dispersed phase and gas is dispersion medium - This statement is incorrect. A cloud is a type of aerosol colloid in which liquid water droplets are dispersed in a gas (air).\n\n[D] Brownian motion of colloidal particles does not depend on the size of the particles but depends on the viscosity of the solution - This statement is incorrect. Brownian motion is the random movement of colloidal particles due to collisions with solvent molecules. The magnitude of Brownian motion depends on the size of the particles and the viscosity of the solution. Smaller particles experience more Brownian motion than larger particles, and particles in more viscous solutions experience less Brownian motion.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is [B]."

It takes into account the orientation of the colliding molecules and the availability of the reaction sites. The value of $P$ depends on the nature of the reactants and the reaction conditions.\n\nOption [A]: The activation energy of a reaction is independent of the steric factor. It is a characteristic property of the reaction and depends only on the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Therefore, option [A] is correct.\n\nOption [B]: The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant $k$ of a reaction to the activation energy $E_a$, the frequency factor $A$, and the temperature $T$:\n\n$$k = A e^{-E_a/RT}$$\n\nThe frequency factor $A$ is related to the collision frequency and the fraction of collisions that have enough energy to overcome the activation barrier. It is independent of the steric factor. Therefore, if the experimentally determined value of $P$ is higher than expected, it means that the effective collision frequency is lower than predicted by the Arrhenius equation. This could be due to factors such as the presence of inhibitors or the formation of non-reactive complexes. Therefore, option [B] is correct.\n\nOption [C]: A steric factor of 4.5 means that only 4.5% of collisions result in a reaction. This does not mean that the reaction will not proceed without a catalyst. It only means that the reaction rate will be slower than expected based on the collision frequency. A catalyst can increase the effective collision frequency by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. Therefore, option [C] is incorrect.\n\nOption [D]: As mentioned earlier, the frequency factor $A$ is independent of the steric factor. Therefore, the value of $A$ predicted by the Arrhenius equation should be the same as the experimentally determined value, assuming that the reaction conditions are the same. Therefore, option [D] is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct options are [A] and [B]."

Let $u = 9+\\sqrt{x}$, so that $x = (u-9)^2$. Then, $dx = 2(u-9)du$, and we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\\begin{align*}\n16(u-9)dy &= \\frac{(4-\\sqrt{u})2(u-9)du}{7+\\sqrt{(u-9)^2+9}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8(u-9)dy &= \\frac{(4-\\sqrt{u})du}{\\sqrt{u+9}}\n\\end{align*}\nNow, we can use separation of variables:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8(u-9)}{(4-\\sqrt{u})}\\frac{dy}{du} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u+9}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8\\int\\frac{(u-9)}{(4-\\sqrt{u})}du &= \\int\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u+9}}dy \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8\\int\\frac{(u-9)(4+\\sqrt{u})}{7}du &= 2\\sqrt{u+9}+C\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

Both $\\mathrm{Fe}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}$ are transition metals and have 8 valence electrons each. In $\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{5}$, there are 5 $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligands, each contributing 2 electrons to the metal center.

However, two of these electrons are used to form the metal-carbon bonds, leaving 16 valence electrons.\n\n(B) These are predominantly low spin in nature: \n\nThis statement is also true. Both $\\mathrm{Fe}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}$ have partially filled d-orbitals, which can participate in bonding with the $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligands. In low spin complexes, the electrons are paired up in the d-orbitals before being placed in higher energy orbitals. This results in a weaker metal-ligand bond and a higher spin state. In contrast, in high spin complexes, the electrons are placed in higher energy orbitals before being paired up. This results in a stronger metal-ligand bond and a lower spin state. Since $\\mathrm{Fe}(\\mathrm{CO})_{5}$ and $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}$ have a low number of valence electrons, they tend to form low spin complexes.\n\n(C) Metal-carbon bond strengthens when the oxidation state of the metal is lowered: \n\nThis statement is false. The strength of the metal-carbon bond depends on the electron density at the metal center. When the oxidation state of the metal is lowered, the metal center has more electrons and a higher electron density. This results in a stronger metal-carbon bond. Therefore, the statement should be \"Metal-carbon bond strengthens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased.\"\n\n(D) The carbonyl C-O bond weakens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased: \n\nThis statement is true. The $\\mathrm{CO}$ ligand is a strong $\\pi$-acceptor, which means that it can accept electrons from the metal center. When the oxidation state of the metal is increased, the metal center has fewer electrons and a lower electron density. This results in a weaker metal-carbon bond and a weaker $\\pi$-backbonding interaction. Therefore, the carbonyl C-O bond weakens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased.\n\nFinal answer: Statements (A), (B), and (D) are correct. Statement (C) is false."

            "content": "(A) $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$ is more basic than $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This statement is true. Group 15 elements show an increasing trend of acidity and decreasing trend of basicity down the group. Therefore, bismuth oxide ($\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$) is more basic than nitrogen oxide ($\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$).\n\n(B) $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$: This statement is true. The covalent character of a bond depends on the electronegativity difference between the two atoms. As we move down the group, the size of the atom increases, and the electronegativity decreases. Therefore, the bond between nitrogen and fluorine in $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than the bond between bismuth and fluorine in $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$.\n\n(C) $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$: This statement is true. The boiling point of a compound depends on the strength of intermolecular forces. Nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus, and hence, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ has stronger hydrogen bonding than $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at a lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.\n\n(D) The $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is stronger than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond: This statement is false. The strength of a bond depends on the bond dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break the bond. The bond dissociation energy of $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ bond is 945 kJ/mol, whereas that of $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ bond is 201 kJ/mol. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is weaker than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond.\n\nFinal answer: (A), (B), and (C) are correct, and (D) is incorrect."

Using Raoult's law, we can write:\n\n$$P_{A} + P_{B} = x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nSince the solution is equimolar, we have $x_{A} = x_{B} = 0.5$. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n$$0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nWe are also given that a new solution of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ having mole fractions $x_{A}$ and $x_{B}$, respectively, has vapour pressure of 22.5 Torr. Using Raoult's law again, we can write:\n\n$$P_{A} + P_{B} = x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ} = 22.5 \\ \\text{Torr}$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution. Dividing the above two equations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{x_{A}P_{A}^{\\circ} + x_{B}P_{B}^{\\circ}} = \\frac{45}{22.5}$$\n\nSubstituting $x_{A} = y$ and $x_{B} = 1-y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{0.5P_{A}^{\\circ} + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{yP_{A}^{\\circ} + (1-y)P_{B}^{\\circ}} = 2$$\n\nSubstituting $P_{A}^{\\circ} = 20$ Torr (given in the problem), we get:\n\n$$\\frac{10 + 0.5P_{B}^{\\circ}}{y\\times 20 + (1-y)P_{B}^{\\circ}} = 2$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{P_{B}^{\\circ}}{3P_{B}^{\\circ} - 40}}$$\n\nFinally, we can substitute $P_{B}^{\\circ} = 45$ Torr (since the equimolar binary solution has vapour pressure 45 Torr) to get:\n\n$$y = \\frac{45}{95} \\approx 0.47$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x_{A} / x_{B}$ in the new solution is approximately $\\boxed{1.13}$."

Using $x+y=\\frac{5}{3}$ and $y-3z=-1$, we can write the line of intersection in parametric form as:\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{5}{3}-4t\\\\\ny&=t\\\\\nz&=\\frac{1}{3}+t\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the direction ratios of the line of intersection are $-4,1,1$, not $1,2,-1$. So statement (A) is false.\n\nTo check statement (B), we need to find the direction ratios of the given line. From the equation $\\frac{3x-4}{9}=\\frac{1-3y}{9}=\\frac{z}{3}$, we can write $x=\\frac{4}{3}+3t$, $y=-\\frac{1}{3}+t$, and $z=3t$. Therefore, the direction ratios of the given line are $3,-1,3$. To check if this line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can take the dot product of their direction vectors:\n\\begin{align*}\n(-4,1,1)\\cdot(3,-1,3)&=-12-1+3\\\\\n&=-10\n\\end{align*}\nSince the dot product is not zero, the two lines are not perpendicular. So statement (B) is false.\n\nTo find the acute angle between $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can use the formula $\\cos\\theta=\\frac{\\vec{n_1}\\cdot\\vec{n_2}}{\\left\\|\\vec{n_1}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\vec{n_2}\\right\\|}$, where $\\vec{n_1}$ and $\\vec{n_2}$ are the normal vectors of $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. The normal vectors are $\\vec{n_1}=(2,1,-1)$ and $\\vec{n_2}=(1,2,1)$. Therefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{(2,1,-1)\\cdot(1,2,1)}{\\left\\|(2,1,-1)\\right\\|\\left\\|(1,2,1)\\right\\|}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{30}\\sqrt{6}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSo $\\theta=60^\\circ$. Therefore, statement (C) is true.\n\nTo find the equation of $P_3$, we need a point on the plane and its normal vector. We are given that the plane is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$, so its normal vector is parallel to the direction vector of the line of intersection, which is $(-4,1,1)$. Since the plane passes through $(4,2,-2)$, its equation can be written as $-4(x-4)+(y-2)+(z+2)=0$, which simplifies to $-4x+y+z+6=0$. Therefore, $P_3$ has equation $-4x+y+z+6=0$.\n\nTo find the distance from $(2,1,1)$ to $P_3$, we can use the formula $\\frac{\\left|\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right|}{\\left\\|\\vec{n}\\right\\|}$, where $\\vec{n}$ is the normal vector of $P_3$ and $\\vec{v}$ is the vector from any point on $P_3$ to $(2,1,1)$. The normal vector of $P_3$ is $(-4,1,1)$, so we can take $\\vec{n}=(-4,1,1)$ and a point on $P_3$ as $(0,-6,2)$. Therefore, $\\vec{v}=(2+0,1+6,1-2)=(2,7,-1)$. Then,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\left|\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{v}\\right|}{\\left\\|\\vec{n}\\right\\|}&=\\frac{\\left|(-4,1,1)\\cdot(2,7,-1)\\right|}{\\left\\|(-4,1,1)\\right\\|}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\left|-8+7-1\\right|}{\\sqrt{18}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nIn summary, the correct statements are (C) and (D)."

By MVT, there exists $c \\in (-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$ such that $g' (c)=\\frac{g(\\epsilon)-g(-\\epsilon)}{2\\epsilon}$. Since $g(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$, we have $g'(c) \\geq 0$. Thus, $g(\\epsilon) \\geq g(-\\epsilon)$ for all $\\epsilon >0$. This implies that $g(x)$ is non-decreasing in a neighborhood of $0$. \n\nSuppose $f$ is not one-to-one on any open interval $(r,s)$. Then there exist $a,b \\in (r,s)$ such that $a<b$ and $f(a)=f(b)$. By Rolle's Theorem, there exists $c \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. Thus, $(f(c))^2+(f'(c))^2=g(c)=g(a)$. Since $g(x)$ is non-decreasing in a neighborhood of $0$, we have $g(c) \\geq g(0)=85$. But this contradicts the fact that $g(c)=85$.\n\nTherefore, $f$ must be one-to-one on some open interval $(r,s)$.\n\n(B) Let $h(x)=\\left|f'(x)\\right|$. Then $h(x) \\leq 2$ for all $x$. Suppose $\\left|f'(x)\\right| >1$ for all $x \\in (-4,0)$. Then $h(x)>1$ for all $x \\in (-4,0)$. By IVT, there exists $c \\in (-4,0)$ such that $h(c)=1$. This contradicts the assumption that $\\left|f'(x)\\right| >1$ for all $x \\in (-4,0)$. Therefore, there exists $x_0 \\in (-4,0)$ such that $\\left|f'(x_0)\\right| \\leq 1$.\n\n(C) Since $f(x) \\in [-2,2]$ for all $x$, we have $f'(x) \\leq 2$ and $f'(x) \\geq -2$ for all $x$.

Let $M=\\max\\{2N,|c_1|,|c_2|\\}$. Then for all $x>M$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)-f(0) &= (f(x)-f(M))+(f(M)-f(0)) \\\\\n&= (f'(c_4))(x-M)+(f(c_4)-f(0)) \\\\\n&\\geq -2(x-M)+f(c_4)-f(0) \\\\\n&> -2(x-M)+1-f(0),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $c_4 \\in (M,x)$.

This means that the distance of the particle from the origin increases with time cubed, so statement (C) is false.\n\nSince the force acting on the particle is not constant (it is zero at $t=0$ and increases with time), statement (A) is false. Finally, since the force acting on the particle is not constant, it is not conservative, so statement (D) is false.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is (B): the speed of the particle is proportional to time."

Stoke's law states that the resistive force on a spherical object moving through a viscous fluid is given by $F = 6\\pi\\eta rv$, where $\\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, $r$ is the radius of the object, and $v$ is the velocity of the object. \n\nFor a thin square plate, we can consider it as a collection of small squares, each of which can be treated as a sphere of radius $r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the center of the square to its corner). Therefore, the resistive force on the plate can be approximated as the sum of the resistive forces on each small square. \n\n(A) The resistive force of liquid on the plate is inversely proportional to $h$: This statement is true. Since the height $h$ of the liquid is much less than the width of the tank, we can assume that the pressure on the top and bottom of the plate is approximately the same. Therefore, the resistive force on each small square is proportional to the area of the square, which is proportional to $h^2$. Since there are $1/h$ such squares along the height of the plate, the total resistive force is inversely proportional to $h$.\n\n(B) The resistive force of liquid on the plate is independent of the area of the plate: This statement is false. As mentioned above, the resistive force on each small square is proportional to its area, so the total resistive force on the plate is proportional to the area of the plate.\n\n(C) The tangential (shear) stress on the floor of the tank increases with $u_{0}$: This statement is true. As the plate is pulled with a constant velocity $u_{0}$, there is a velocity gradient in the fluid near the plate. This velocity gradient results in a shear stress on the floor of the tank, which increases with $u_{0}$.\n\n(D) The tangential (shear) stress on the plate varies linearly with the viscosity $\\eta$ of the liquid: This statement is true. The shear stress on the plate is given by $\\tau = \\eta \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$, where $u$ is the velocity of the fluid and $y$ is the distance from the plate. Since the plate is moving with a constant velocity $u_{0}$, we have $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{u_{0}}{h}$. Therefore, the shear stress on the plate is proportional to $\\eta u_{0}/h$, which varies linearly with $\\eta$.\n\nFinal answer: (A), (C), and (D) are true, while (B) is false."

Therefore, just after the bounce, the kinetic energy of the ball is half of its initial kinetic energy. The potential energy of the ball just after the bounce is equal to its potential energy at the maximum height.

We can use the same kinematic equation as before, but with the initial velocity equal to the velocity just after the bounce, and the maximum height equal to the height the ball reaches after the bounce. We get:\n\n$$v_{y}^{2} = u_{y}^{2} - 2gh$$\n\nwhere $v_{y}$ is the final vertical velocity (which is zero at the maximum height), $u_{y}$ is the initial vertical velocity (which is equal to the vertical component of the velocity just after the bounce), $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the maximum height after the bounce.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$h = \\frac{v_{y}^{2}}{2g} = \\frac{1176}{2 \\times 9.8} \\approx 60.00 \\mathrm{~m}$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum height the ball reaches after the bounce is approximately $\\boxed{60.00}$ metres."

In other words, it is an oxygen atom that connects two parts of a molecule.\n\nTo determine whether a compound has a bridging oxo group, we need to examine its structure. We can use the following guidelines:\n\n- A compound with a single non-metal atom (such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$) cannot have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with two non-metal atoms that are not connected by an oxygen atom (such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$) cannot have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with two non-metal atoms that are connected by an oxygen atom (such as $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$) may have a bridging oxo group.\n- A compound with more than two non-metal atoms may have multiple bridging oxo groups.\n\nUsing these guidelines, we can examine each compound in turn:\n\n- $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$: This compound has two nitrogen atoms and three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single nitrogen atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This compound has two nitrogen atoms and five oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single nitrogen atom, while the other three oxygen atoms are bonded to both nitrogen atoms. Therefore, there is one bridging oxo group.\n- $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{6}$: This compound has four phosphorus atoms and six oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single phosphorus atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{P}_{4} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$: This compound has four phosphorus atoms and seven oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other five oxygen atoms are bonded to two phosphorus atoms.

One oxygen atom is bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other four oxygen atoms are bonded to both phosphorus atoms. Therefore, there is one bridging oxo group.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{P}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{10}$: This compound has five hydrogen atoms, three phosphorus atoms, and ten oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygen atoms are bonded to a single phosphorus atom, while the other eight oxygen atoms are bonded to two or three phosphorus atoms. Therefore, there are four bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3}$: This compound has two hydrogen atoms, two sulfur atoms, and three oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom is bonded to a single sulfur atom, so there are no bridging oxo groups.\n- $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$: This compound has two hydrogen atoms, two sulfur atoms, and five oxygen atoms.

Since the particles are moving in circular orbits, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force, i.e., $F = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$, where $v$ is the speed of the particles. Equating these two expressions for $F$, we get $v^2 = \\frac{Gm}{r}$.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the particles in a spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$ is given by $dK = \\frac{1}{2}m n(r) 4\\pi r^2 v^2 dr$, where $n(r)$ is the number density of particles in the shell.

            "content": "We can solve this problem using the principle of superposition. We can consider the original charged shell and the hole separately and then add their contributions to get the final result.\n\nFirst, let's consider the original charged shell. The potential at a distance $r$ from the center of the shell is given by:\n\n$$V_{1}(r) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the total charge on the shell and $\\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space. We can find $Q$ by using the fact that the potential at the surface of the shell is $V_{0}$:\n\n$$V_{1}(R) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} = V_{0}$$\n\nSolving for $Q$, we get:\n\n$$Q = 4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R V_{0}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the hole. Since the hole is small, we can treat it as a point charge $-Q_{h}$ located at the center of the shell. The potential at a distance $r$ from the center of the shell due to this point charge is given by:\n\n$$V_{2}(r) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{-Q_{h}}{r}$$\n\nWe can find $Q_{h}$ by using the fact that the potential at the surface of the hole is also $V_{0}$:\n\n$$V_{2}(R\\sqrt{1-\\alpha}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{-Q_{h}}{R\\sqrt{1-\\alpha}} = V_{0}$$\n\nSolving for $Q_{h}$, we get:\n\n$$Q_{h} = -4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} V_{0}$$\n\nNow, we can find the potential at the center of the shell by adding the contributions from the original charged shell and the hole:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = V_{1}(0) + V_{2}(0) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q}{R} - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q_{h}}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $Q$ and $Q_{h}$, we get:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\left(4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R V_{0}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\left(-4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} V_{0}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$V_{tot}(0) = V_{0} \\left(1 + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}\\right)$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $2 \\alpha V_{0}$. The potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $V_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}$ due to the presence of the hole. So, the reduction in potential is:\n\n$$\\Delta V = V_{0} - V_{tot}(0) = V_{0} - V_{0} \\left(1 + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}\\right) = -V_{0} \\sqrt{1-\\alpha}$$\n\nSince $\\alpha \\ll 1$, we can approximate $\\sqrt{1-\\alpha} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ and get:\n\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -V_{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) = 2 \\alpha V_{0}$$\n\nTherefore, the potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $2 \\alpha V_{0}$ due to the presence of the hole."

Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta T_{\\text{f}} = 5.12 \\mathrm{~K} \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\times 0.164 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{~kg}^{-1} = 0.839 \\mathrm{~K}$$\n\nTherefore, the depression of freezing point of benzene upon addition of the solute is $0.84 \\mathrm{~K}$ (rounded to 2 decimal places)."
