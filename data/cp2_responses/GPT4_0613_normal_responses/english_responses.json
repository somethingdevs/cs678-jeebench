Therefore, the enthalpy change (\u0394H) is negative, indicating a decrease in enthalpy. During adsorption, the molecules on the surface of the adsorbent become more ordered, leading to a decrease in entropy (\u0394S). So, this statement is correct.\n\n[B] The critical temperatures of ethane and nitrogen are $563 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $126 \\mathrm{~K}$, respectively. The adsorption of ethane will be more than that of nitrogen on the same amount of activated charcoal at a given temperature\n\nThe critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied. Gases with higher critical temperatures are more easily adsorbed because they can be more easily liquefied. Since the critical temperature of ethane is higher than that of nitrogen, ethane will be more easily adsorbed on activated charcoal at a given temperature. So, this statement is also correct.\n\n[C] Cloud is an emulsion type of colloid in which liquid is dispersed phase and gas is dispersion medium\n\nA cloud is actually an aerosol type of colloid, not an emulsion. In a cloud, tiny water droplets or ice crystals (the dispersed phase) are suspended in the air (the dispersion medium). So, this statement is incorrect.\n\n[D] Brownian motion of colloidal particles does not depend on the size of the particles but depends on viscosity of the solution\n\nBrownian motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collisions with other particles and molecules. The Brownian motion of colloidal particles depends on both the size of the particles and the viscosity of the solution. Smaller particles and lower viscosity solutions result in faster Brownian motion. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nFinal answer: The correct statements are [A] and [B]."

It is a measure of the fraction of collisions that have the correct orientation for the reaction to occur. The steric factor is incorporated into the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of reaction rates:\n\n$k = PAe^{-E_a/RT}$\n\nwhere $k$ is the rate constant, $P$ is the steric factor, $A$ is the frequency factor (also known as the pre-exponential factor), $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n[A] The activation energy of the reaction is unaffected by the value of the steric factor.\n\nThis statement is true. The activation energy ($E_a$) is a property of the reaction and is independent of the steric factor ($P$). The steric factor only affects the overall rate constant ($k$) but does not change the activation energy.\n\n[B] Experimentally determined value of frequency factor is higher than that predicted by Arrhenius equation.\n\nThis statement is true. Since the steric factor ($P$) is greater than 1, it means that the experimentally determined rate constant ($k$) is higher than what would be predicted by the Arrhenius equation without considering the steric factor. Therefore, the experimentally determined frequency factor ($PA$) must also be higher than the frequency factor predicted by the Arrhenius equation ($A$).\n\n[C] Since $\\mathrm{P}=4.5$, the reaction will not proceed unless an effective catalyst is used.\n\nThis statement is false. A steric factor greater than 1 indicates that the reaction is more likely to occur than predicted by the Arrhenius equation without considering the steric factor. It does not imply that a catalyst is necessary for the reaction to proceed.\n\n[D] The value of frequency factor predicted by Arrhenius equation is higher than that determined experimentally.\n\nThis statement is false. As explained in option [B], the experimentally determined frequency factor ($PA$) is higher than the frequency factor predicted by the Arrhenius equation ($A$) because the steric factor ($P$) is greater than 1.\n\nFinal answer: [A] and [B] are correct."

So, statement [C] is incorrect.\n\n[D] The Lewis acidity of $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ is greater than that of $\\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}$\n\nLewis acidity is the ability of a compound to accept an electron pair. In general, the Lewis acidity of a compound increases with the increase in the positive charge on the central atom and the decrease in the size of the central atom. In the case of $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ and $\\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}$, both have the same charge on the central atom, but the size of the boron atom is smaller than that of the aluminum atom. Therefore, the Lewis acidity of $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ is greater than that of $\\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}$. So, statement [D] is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: [A], [B], and [D] are correct statements."

Magnetic field due to the wire at $x = +R$:\n\nUsing Ampere's law, the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from a straight wire carrying current $I$ is given by $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi r}$. At the origin, the distance from the wire at $x = +R$ is $r = R$. The direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule, which means it will be in the $-\\hat{k}$ direction. Therefore, the magnetic field due to the wire at $x = +R$ is:\n\n$\\vec{B_1} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi R}\\hat{k}$\n\n2. Magnetic field due to the wire at $x = -R$:\n\nSimilarly, the magnetic field due to the wire at $x = -R$ is:\n\n$\\vec{B_2} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_2}{2\\pi R}\\hat{k}$\n\n3. Magnetic field due to the circular loop:\n\nThe magnetic field at the center of a circular loop carrying current $I$ and having radius $R$ is given by $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}$, where $z$ is the distance between the center of the loop and the point where the magnetic field is being calculated. In this case, $z = \\sqrt{3}R$. The direction of the magnetic field is given by the right-hand rule, which means it will be in the $+\\hat{k}$ direction. Therefore, the magnetic field due to the circular loop is:\n\n$\\vec{B_3} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I R^2}{2(R^2 + (\\sqrt{3}R)^2)^{3/2}}\\hat{k} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}\\hat{k}$\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given statements:\n\n(A) If $I_1 = I_2$, then $\\vec{B}$ cannot be equal to zero at the origin $(0,0,0)$\n\nIf $I_1 = I_2$, then the magnetic fields due to the wires at $x = \\pm R$ will cancel each other out, i.e., $\\vec{B_1} + \\vec{B_2} = 0$. However, the magnetic field due to the circular loop, $\\vec{B_3}$, is non-zero. Therefore, the total magnetic field at the origin cannot be zero. This statement is true.\n\n(B) If $I_1 > 0$ and $I_2 < 0$, then $\\vec{B}$ can be equal to zero at the origin $(0,0,0)$\n\nIn this case, both $\\vec{B_1}$ and $\\vec{B_2}$ are in the $-\\hat{k}$ direction. If the magnitudes of $\\vec{B_1}$ and $\\vec{B_2}$ are such that their sum equals the magnitude of $\\vec{B_3}$, then the total magnetic field at the origin can be zero. This statement is true.\n\n(C) If $I_1 < 0$ and $I_2 > 0$, then $\\vec{B}$ can be equal to zero at the origin $(0,0,0)$\n\nThis case is similar to the previous one, but with the directions of $\\vec{B_1}$ and $\\vec{B_2}$ reversed. The same reasoning applies, and this statement is also true.\n\n(D) If $I_1 = I_2$, then the $z$-component of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is $\\left(-\\frac{\\mu_{0} I}{2 R}\\right)$\n\nIf $I_1 = I_2$, then the magnetic fields due to the wires at $x = \\pm R$ will cancel each other out, i.e., $\\vec{B_1} + \\vec{B_2} = 0$. Therefore, the $z$-component of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is given by the magnetic field due to the circular loop, which is $\\vec{B_3} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2R}\\hat{k}$. This statement is false.\n\nFinal answer: (A), (B), and (C) are true."

The acceleration of a rolling body down an inclined plane is given by $a = \\frac{g \\sin{\\theta}}{1 + k}$, where $k$ is the radius of gyration of the body.\n\nFor a ring, $k = 1$, so its acceleration $a_1 = \\frac{g \\sin{60^{\\circ}}}{1 + 1} = \\frac{10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} m/s^2$.\n\nFor a disc, $k = \\frac{1}{2}$, so its acceleration $a_2 = \\frac{g \\sin{60^{\\circ}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3} m/s^2$.\n\nNow, we can use the equation of motion $s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2$ for both the ring and the disc, where $s$ is the distance traveled along the inclined plane, $u$ is the initial velocity (which is 0 for both), and $t$ is the time taken.

Plugging these values into the lens formula, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{v}$\n\nSolving for $v$, we find that $v = 220 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nNow, we can find the magnification of the lens using the formula:\n\n$magnification = \\frac{v}{u}$\n\nPlugging in the values for $v$ and $u$, we get:\n\n$magnification = \\frac{220}{20} = 11$\n\nNow that we have the magnification, we can find the new intensity of the light at a distance of 22 cm from the lens. Since the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the new intensity will be:\n\n$new \\ intensity = \\frac{old \\ intensity}{magnification^2}$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$new \\ intensity = \\frac{1.3}{11^2} = \\frac{1.3}{121} = 0.0107438 \\mathrm{~kW} \\mathrm{~m}^{-2}$\n\nRounding to the 2nd decimal digit, the average intensity of light at a distance of 22 cm from the lens on the other side is:\n\n$new \\ intensity = 0.01 \\mathrm{~kW} \\mathrm{~m}^{-2}$"

Therefore, the total number of valence shell electrons at the metal center is $8 + 5 \\times 2 = 18$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{CO})_{4}$, the nickel atom has 10 valence electrons (from its 3d and 4s orbitals), and each CO ligand donates 2 electrons to the metal center. Therefore, the total number of valence shell electrons at the metal center is $10 + 4 \\times 2 = 18$.\n\nIn both cases, the total number of valence shell electrons at the metal center is 18, not 16. So, statement (A) is incorrect.\n\n(B) These are predominantly low spin in nature\n\nBinary transition metal carbonyl compounds are generally low spin because the CO ligands are strong field ligands, which cause a large splitting of the d orbitals. This results in the electrons preferentially occupying the lower energy orbitals, leading to a low spin configuration. So, statement (B) is correct.\n\n(C) Metal-carbon bond strengthens when the oxidation state of the metal is lowered\n\nWhen the oxidation state of the metal is lowered, it means that the metal has more electrons available for bonding. This results in stronger metal-carbon bonds due to increased electron density between the metal and carbon atoms. So, statement (C) is correct.\n\n(D) The carbonyl C-O bond weakens when the oxidation state of the metal is increased\n\nWhen the oxidation state of the metal is increased, it means that the metal has fewer electrons available for bonding. This results in a weaker back-bonding interaction between the metal and the CO ligand, which in turn weakens the C-O bond in the carbonyl group.

As a result, the ability to donate electron pairs to form a bond with a proton decreases. Since Bismuth (Bi) is below Nitrogen (N) in the periodic table, $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$ is less basic than $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{5}$. So, option (A) is incorrect.\n\n(B) $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$\n\nCovalent character in a bond increases with the decrease in the electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms. Nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than Bismuth (Bi), so the electronegativity difference between N and F is less than that between Bi and F. Therefore, $\\mathrm{NF}_{3}$ is more covalent than $\\mathrm{BiF}_{3}$. So, option (B) is correct.\n\n(C) $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$\n\nBoiling points of compounds depend on the strength of intermolecular forces. In the case of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, there is hydrogen bonding between the molecules, which is a strong intermolecular force. In $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$, there is no hydrogen bonding, and the intermolecular forces are weaker van der Waals forces. Therefore, $\\mathrm{PH}_{3}$ boils at a lower temperature than $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. So, option (C) is correct.\n\n(D) The $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is stronger than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond\n\nThe strength of a single bond depends on the extent of overlap between the orbitals of the bonded atoms. In the case of the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond, the overlap between the smaller 2p orbitals of nitrogen is more effective than the overlap between the larger 3p orbitals of phosphorus in the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond. As a result, the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{N}$ single bond is stronger than the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{P}$ single bond. So, option (D) is correct.\n\nFinal answer: (B), (C), and (D) are correct."

Therefore, $\\arg(z) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-1}{-1}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(1)$. However, we need to find the principal argument, which lies in the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. Since both the real and imaginary parts of $z$ are negative, the principal argument should be in the third quadrant. Thus, $\\arg(-1 - i) = \\tan^{-1}(1) + \\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$. This contradicts the given statement, so (A) is FALSE.\n\n(B) The function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow(-\\pi, \\pi]$, defined by $f(t)=\\arg (-1+i t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, is continuous at all points of $\\mathbb{R}$\n\nFor $z = -1 + it$, we have $\\text{Re}(z) = -1$ and $\\text{Im}(z) = t$.

Similarly, we have $\\arg\\left(\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right) = \\arg(z_1) - \\arg(z_2) + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Therefore,\n\\[\n\\arg \\left(\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}\\right)-\\arg \\left(z_{1}\\right)+\\arg \\left(z_{2}\\right) = 2m\\pi,\n\\]\nwhich is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.

Then, the given condition is $\\arg(w) = \\pi$. Since the argument of a complex number is $\\pi$ if and only if the complex number is a negative real number, we have $w = -r$ for some positive real number $r$.

Thus, (D) is TRUE.\n\nIn conclusion, the only FALSE statement is (A)."

            "content": "We are given a triangle $PQR$ with $\\angle PQR = 30^\\circ$, $PQ = 10\\sqrt{3}$, and $QR = 10$. We will check each statement one by one.\n\n(A) To find $\\angle QPR$, we can use the Law of Sines:\n\\[\\frac{PQ}{\\sin\\angle QRP} = \\frac{QR}{\\sin\\angle PQR}\\]\n\\[\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{\\sin\\angle QRP} = \\frac{10}{\\sin 30^\\circ}\\]\n\\[\\sin\\angle QRP = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{20}\\]\n\\[\\sin\\angle QRP = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]\n\\[\\angle QRP = 60^\\circ\\]\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle QPR = 180^\\circ - 30^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 90^\\circ$. This means $\\angle QPR \\neq 45^\\circ$, so statement (A) is FALSE.\n\n(B) To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$, where $a$ and $b$ are the sides and $C$ is the angle between them. In this case, we have $a = PQ = 10\\sqrt{3}$, $b = QR = 10$, and $C = \\angle PQR = 30^\\circ$. So,\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2}(10\\sqrt{3})(10)\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}(10\\sqrt{3})(10)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 25\\sqrt{3}\\]\nThe area of the triangle is indeed $25\\sqrt{3}$. Now, we need to find $\\angle QRP$. We already found that $\\angle QRP = 60^\\circ$, so $\\angle QRP \\neq 120^\\circ$. Therefore, statement (B) is FALSE.\n\n(C) To find the radius of the incircle, we can use the formula $r = \\frac{A}{s}$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle and $s$ is the semiperimeter. We already found that $A = 25\\sqrt{3}$. To find the semiperimeter, we first need to find the third side of the triangle, $PR$. We can use the Law of Cosines:\n\\[PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 - 2(PQ)(QR)\\cos\\angle PQR\\]\n\\[PR^2 = (10\\sqrt{3})^2 + 10^2 - 2(10\\sqrt{3})(10)\\cos 30^\\circ\\]\n\\[PR^2 = 300 + 100 - 200\\sqrt{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\]\n\\[PR^2 = 400 - 300\\]\n\\[PR = 10\\]\nNow we can find the semiperimeter:\n\\[s = \\frac{PQ + QR + PR}{2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3} + 10 + 10}{2} = 10\\sqrt{3} + 10\\]\nNow we can find the radius of the incircle:\n\\[r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{10\\sqrt{3} + 10} = \\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{25(3 - \\sqrt{3})}{10(2)} = \\frac{75 - 25\\sqrt{3}}{20}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{15}{4}(3 - \\sqrt{3})\\]\nThis is not equal to $10\\sqrt{3} - 15$, so statement (C) is FALSE.\n\n(D) To find the area of the circumcircle, we first need to find the circumradius $R$. We can use the formula $R = \\frac{abc}{4A}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides of the triangle and $A$ is the area. We already found that $A = 25\\sqrt{3}$, and we have $a = PQ = 10\\sqrt{3}$, $b = QR = 10$, and $c = PR = 10$. So,\n\\[R = \\frac{(10\\sqrt{3})(10)(10)}{4(25\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{1000\\sqrt{3}}{100\\sqrt{3}} = 10\\]\nNow we can find the area of the circumcircle, which is given by the formula $A = \\pi R^2$:\n\\[A = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi\\]\nSo, statement (D) is TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that only statement (D) is true."

            "content": "To find the line of intersection of the two planes $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can solve the system of equations formed by the given equations of the planes. Let's write the given equations in the form $ax + by + cz = d$:\n\n$P_1: 2x + y - z = 3$\n$P_2: x + 2y + z = 2$\n\nTo find the line of intersection, we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate $z$ by adding the two equations:\n\n$(2x + y - z) + (x + 2y + z) = 3 + 2$\n\n$3x + 3y = 5$\n\nNow, let's express $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$x = \\frac{5 - 3y}{3}$\n\nNow we can find the direction ratios of the line of intersection. The direction ratios are given by the cross product of the normal vectors of the two planes. The normal vectors of the planes are:\n\n$N_1 = \\langle 2, 1, -1 \\rangle$\n$N_2 = \\langle 1, 2, 1 \\rangle$\n\nThe cross product of these two vectors is:\n\n$N_1 \\times N_2 = \\langle (1)(1) - (-1)(2), (-1)(1) - (1)(1), (2)(2) - (1)(1) \\rangle = \\langle 1, -2, 3 \\rangle$\n\nSo, the direction ratios of the line of intersection are $1, -2, 3$. This means that option (A) is incorrect.\n\nNow let's check option (B). The given line can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{3x - 4}{9} = \\frac{1 - 3y}{9} = \\frac{z}{3}$\n\nLet's find the direction ratios of this line. We can do this by equating the parameter $t$ to each of the fractions:\n\n$t = \\frac{3x - 4}{9} = \\frac{1 - 3y}{9} = \\frac{z}{3}$\n\nNow we can find the direction ratios by taking the derivatives of $x, y, z$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -3$\n$\\frac{dz}{dt} = 3$\n\nSo, the direction ratios of the given line are $3, -3, 3$. To check if this line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can take the dot product of their direction ratios:\n\n$(1)(3) + (-2)(-3) + (3)(3) = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18$\n\nSince the dot product is not zero, the given line is not perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$. So, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nNow let's check option (C). To find the angle between the two planes, we can use the formula:\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{N_1 \\cdot N_2}{\\|N_1\\| \\|N_2\\|}$\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{(2)(1) + (1)(2) + (-1)(1)}{\\sqrt{(2^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2)(1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2)}}$\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{6 \\cdot 6}} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\theta = \\arccos \\frac{1}{2} = 60^\\circ$\n\nSo, the acute angle between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is indeed $60^\\circ$. This means that option (C) is correct.\n\nFinally, let's check option (D). We are given that $P_3$ passes through the point $(4, 2, -2)$ and is perpendicular to the line of intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$. Since the line of intersection has direction ratios $1, -2, 3$, the normal vector of $P_3$ must be parallel to this direction. So, the equation of $P_3$ can be written as:\n\n$(x - 4) + 2(y - 2) - 3(z + 2) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 10$\n\nNow we need to find the distance of the point $(2, 1, 1)$ from the plane $P_3$. We can use the formula:\n\n$D = \\frac{|ax + by + cz - d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$\n\n$D = \\frac{|(1)(2) + (2)(1) - (3)(1) - 10|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-3)^2}}$\n\n$D = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{14}}$\n\nSo, the distance of the point $(2, 1, 1)$ from the plane $P_3$ is not $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$. This means that option (D) is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct option is (C)."

The common difference is $d_X = 5$. The nth term of an arithmetic progression can be found using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. So, the last term of set $X$ is $a_{2018}^X = 1 + (2018-1)5 = 10086$.\n\nSet $Y$ consists of the first 2018 terms of the arithmetic progression $9, 16, 23, \\ldots$. The common difference is $d_Y = 7$. The last term of set $Y$ is $a_{2018}^Y = 9 + (2018-1)7 = 14125$.\n\nNow, we need to find the elements that are common to both sets. Since the common difference of set $X$ is 5 and the common difference of set $Y$ is 7, the common elements will be multiples of the LCM of 5 and 7, which is 35. The first common element is $1 + 5k = 9 + 7l$, where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Solving for $k$ and $l$, we get $k = 4$ and $l = 3$. So, the first common element is $1 + 5(4) = 21$. \n\nTo find the last common element, we need to find the largest multiple of 35 that is less than or equal to the last term of set $X$, which is 10086. The largest multiple of 35 less than or equal to 10086 is 10080. So, the last common element is 10080.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of common elements. Since the common elements are multiples of 35, we can find the number of common elements by dividing the difference between the last and first common elements by 35 and adding 1. \n\nNumber of common elements = $\\frac{10080 - 21}{35} + 1 = 287$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of elements in the set $X \\cup Y$. Since there are 2018 elements in each set and 287 common elements, the number of elements in the set $X \\cup Y$ is:\n\n$2018 + 2018 - 287 = 3749$.\n\nSo, the number of elements in the set $X \\cup Y$ is 3749."

We know that the kinetic energy of a particle is given by $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is its velocity. \n\nDifferentiating $K$ with respect to time, we get:\n\n$\\frac{dK}{dt} = m \\cdot v \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt}$\n\nNow, we can equate this expression with the given expression for the rate of change of kinetic energy:\n\n$m \\cdot v \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\gamma t$\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) The force applied on the particle is constant\n\nThe force applied on the particle can be written as $F = m \\cdot a$, where $a$ is the acceleration of the particle. Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, we can write $a = \\frac{dv}{dt}$. Thus, the force can be written as:\n\n$F = m \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt}$\n\nFrom the equation $m \\cdot v \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\gamma t$, we can write the force as:\n\n$F = \\frac{\\gamma t}{v}$\n\nSince the force depends on both time and velocity, it is not constant. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\n(B) The speed of the particle is proportional to time\n\nFrom the equation $m \\cdot v \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\gamma t$, we can write the acceleration as:\n\n$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{\\gamma t}{m \\cdot v}$\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides with respect to time:\n\n$\\int_{0}^{v} \\frac{dv}{v} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\gamma}{m} dt$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$\\ln(v) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2m} t^2 + C$\n\nTo find the constant of integration $C$, we can use the initial condition that the particle is at rest at the origin, i.e., $v(0) = 0$. This gives us:\n\n$\\ln(0) = C$\n\nHowever, this is not possible since the natural logarithm of 0 is undefined. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the speed of the particle is proportional to time. Option (B) is incorrect.\n\n(C) The distance of the particle from the origin increases linearly with time\n\nTo find the distance traveled by the particle, we need to integrate the velocity with respect to time:\n\n$x(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} v(t) dt$\n\nHowever, we do not have an explicit expression for $v(t)$, so we cannot determine whether the distance increases linearly with time. Option (C) is incorrect.\n\n(D) The force is conservative\n\nA force is conservative if its work done on a particle moving between two points is independent of the path taken. Mathematically, a force $F$ is conservative if its curl is zero, i.e., $\\nabla \\times F = 0$. In one dimension, this condition is always satisfied. Therefore, the force is conservative.

Finding the initial velocity:\n\nWe know that the maximum height reached by the ball is 120 m. We can use the following equation to find the initial vertical velocity component:\n\n$v_y^2 = u_y^2 - 2gh$\n\nwhere $v_y$ is the final vertical velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), $u_y$ is the initial vertical velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2), and $h$ is the maximum height (120 m).\n\n$0 = u_y^2 - 2(9.81)(120)$\n\n$u_y^2 = 2(9.81)(120)$\n\n$u_y = \\sqrt{2(9.81)(120)}$\n\n$u_y \\approx 48.52 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nSince the angle of projection is $45^{\\circ}$, the initial horizontal velocity component $u_x$ is equal to the initial vertical velocity component $u_y$.\n\n$u_x = u_y \\approx 48.52 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nThe initial velocity of the ball is:\n\n$u = \\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2} = \\sqrt{(48.52)^2 + (48.52)^2} \\approx 68.60 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\n2. Finding the velocity just before hitting the ground:\n\nSince the horizontal velocity component remains constant throughout the motion, the horizontal velocity component just before hitting the ground is the same as the initial horizontal velocity component:\n\n$v_x = u_x \\approx 48.52 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nThe vertical velocity component just before hitting the ground is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the initial vertical velocity component:\n\n$v_y = -u_y \\approx -48.52 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\nThe velocity just before hitting the ground is:\n\n$v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \\sqrt{(48.52)^2 + (-48.52)^2} \\approx 68.60 \\mathrm{~m/s}$\n\n3.

When hydrogen sulfide ($\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$) is passed through an acidic solution containing $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions, a black precipitate of copper sulfide ($\\mathrm{CuS}$) is formed. In contrast, $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ ions do not form a precipitate under acidic conditions.\n\n(C) Only $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ shows the formation of precipitate by passing $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ in faintly basic medium\n\nThis statement is true as well. When hydrogen sulfide ($\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$) is passed through a faintly basic solution containing $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ ions, a pinkish-brown precipitate of manganese sulfide ($\\mathrm{MnS}$) is formed. In contrast, $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions do not form a precipitate under faintly basic conditions.\n\n(D) $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \\mathrm{Cu}$ has higher reduction potential than $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+} / \\mathrm{Mn}$ (measured under similar conditions)\n\nThis statement is true. The reduction potential of $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \\mathrm{Cu}$ is +0.34 V, while the reduction potential of $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+} / \\mathrm{Mn}$ is -1.18 V. Since the reduction potential of $\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \\mathrm{Cu}$ is higher, it indicates that copper ions are more easily reduced to copper metal than manganese ions are to manganese metal.\n\nFinal Answer: All the given options (A), (B), (C), and (D) are correct."

We can do this by choosing the elements such that the products have the maximum possible absolute value.\n\nLet's consider the first term, $a(ei - fh)$. To maximize the absolute value of this term, we can choose $a = 1$, $e = 1$, $i = 1$, $f = -1$, and $h = -1$. This gives us a maximum value of $1(1 - 1) = 1$ for the first term.\n\nNow let's consider the second term, $-b(di - fg)$. To maximize the absolute value of this term, we can choose $b = 1$, $d = 1$, $i = 1$, $f = -1$, and $g = -1$. This gives us a maximum value of $-1(1 - 1) = -1$ for the second term.\n\nFinally, let's consider the third term, $c(dh - eg)$. To maximize the absolute value of this term, we can choose $c = 1$, $d = 1$, $h = 1$, $e = -1$, and $g = -1$. This gives us a maximum value of $1(1 - 1) = 1$ for the third term.\n\nAdding the maximum values of the three terms, we get:\n\n$1 - 1 + 1 = 1$\n\nHowever, this is not the maximum possible value of the determinant. We can find a higher value by choosing different elements for the matrix $P$. Let's try the following matrix:\n\n$P = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nCalculating the determinant, we get:\n\n$\\det(P) = 1(1 - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-1)(1) - (-1)(-1)) + 1((-1)(-1) - 1) = 1(0) - 1(0) + 1(-1) = -1$\n\nNow let's try another matrix:\n\n$P = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nCalculating the determinant, we get:\n\n$\\det(P) = 1(1 - 1) - (-1)(1 - 1) + 1(1 - (-1)(1)) = 0 + 0 + 1(2) = 2$\n\nThis is a higher value than the previous determinants, so the maximum possible value of the determinant of $P$ is $\\boxed{2}$."

The normal to the plane has direction ratios (1, 1, 0), so we have:\n\n$\\frac{x_1 - 0}{1} = \\frac{y_1 - 0}{1} = \\frac{z_1 - z_2}{0}$\n\nSince the denominator in the last fraction is 0, we must have $z_1 = z_2$.

This distance is equal to the length of the perpendicular dropped from P to the x-axis. Let this perpendicular meet the x-axis at point S. Then, the coordinates of S are $(x_1, 0, z_1) = (3, 0, z)$. The distance PS is given by:\n\n$PS = \\sqrt{(x_1 - 3)^2 + (y_1 - 0)^2 + (z_1 - z)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (z - z)^2} = 3$\n\nSince we know that PS = 5, we have:\n\n$5 = 3$\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that our assumption that PQ is perpendicular to the plane $x+y=3$ is incorrect. Therefore, there is no such point P in the first octant, and the length of PR is undefined."

            "content": "We will first find the potential at the center of the shell before the hole is made. Since the charge is uniformly distributed on the shell, we can use the formula for the potential of a uniformly charged sphere:\n\n$V_{0} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{R}$\n\nwhere $Q$ is the total charge on the sphere and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nNow, let's find the charge removed from the shell when the hole is made. The area of the hole is $\\alpha 4\\pi R^2$, so the fraction of the total area removed is $\\alpha$. Since the charge is uniformly distributed, the charge removed is also a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total charge:\n\n$\\Delta Q = \\alpha Q$\n\nNow, let's find the potential at the center of the shell after the hole is made. The remaining charge on the shell is $(1-\\alpha)Q$. Using the formula for the potential of a uniformly charged sphere, we get:\n\n$V' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(1-\\alpha)Q}{R}$\n\nNow, let's find the change in potential at the center of the shell:\n\n$\\Delta V = V' - V_{0} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(1-\\alpha)Q}{R} - \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{R} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{R}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $V_{0}$:\n\n$\\Delta V = -\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Q}{R} = -\\alpha V_{0}$\n\nSo, the potential at the center of the shell is reduced by $\\alpha V_{0}$, not $2\\alpha V_{0}$. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's find the electric field at the center of the shell before the hole is made. Since the shell is an insulator, the electric field inside the shell is zero. Therefore, the electric field at the center of the shell before the hole is made is zero.\n\nAfter the hole is made, the electric field at the center of the shell is still zero. This is because the remaining charge on the shell is still uniformly distributed, and the electric field inside a uniformly charged insulating sphere is zero. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at the center of the shell is not reduced by $\\frac{\\alpha V_{0}}{2 R}$. Option (B) is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the potential at the center of the shell to that of the point at $\\frac{1}{2} R$ from the center towards the hole after the hole is made. The potential at the center of the shell is $V' = (1-\\alpha)V_{0}$, as we found earlier.\n\nTo find the potential at the point at $\\frac{1}{2} R$ from the center towards the hole, we can use the formula for the potential of a uniformly charged sphere with a hole:\n\n$V'' = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(1-\\alpha)Q}{\\frac{1}{2}R}$\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the potential at the center of the shell to that of the point at $\\frac{1}{2} R$ from the center towards the hole:\n\n$\\frac{V'}{V''} = \\frac{(1-\\alpha)V_{0}}{\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{(1-\\alpha)Q}{\\frac{1}{2}R}} = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{1-2\\alpha}$\n\nSo, the ratio of the potential at the center of the shell to that of the point at $\\frac{1}{2} R$ from the center towards the hole is $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1-2\\alpha}$. Option (C) is correct.\n\nSince we have found the correct option, we do not need to check option (D).\n\nThe final answer is (C) The ratio of the potential at the center of the shell to that of the point at $\\frac{1}{2} R$ from center towards the hole will be $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1-2 \\alpha}$."

The voltmeter is connected in parallel with the resistor, and the ammeter is connected in series with the resistor.\n\nThe equivalent resistance of the voltmeter and the 1000 $\\Omega$ resistor connected in parallel is:\n\n$R_{eq} = \\frac{1000 \\times 50,000}{1000 + 50,000} = \\frac{50,000,000}{51,000} \\approx 980.39 \\Omega$\n\nThe total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the equivalent resistance and the resistance of the ammeter:\n\n$R_{total} = 980.39 + 9.98 = 990.37 \\Omega$\n\nThe measured value of the resistance will be the equivalent resistance, which is:\n\n$978 \\Omega < 980.39 \\Omega < 982 \\Omega$\n\nTherefore, option (C) is correct.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case when the ideal cell is replaced by a cell having an internal resistance of 5 $\\Omega$. The total resistance in the circuit will now be:\n\n$R_{total} = 980.39 + 9.98 + 5 = 995.37 \\Omega$\n\nThe measured value of the resistance will still be the equivalent resistance, which is:\n\n$980.39 \\Omega$\n\nSince the measured value of the resistance is less than 1000 $\\Omega$, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct options are (A) and (C)."

N2O4 (Dinitrogen tetroxide): In this molecule, there are two nitrogen atoms bonded to each other, so it contains a covalent bond between two atoms of the same kind.\n\n5.

The given reaction is:\n\nXeF4 + O2F2 \u2192 Y\n\nSince xenon (Xe) and oxygen (O) both belong to Group 16 (also known as Group VI) of the periodic table, they have 6 valence electrons each. Fluorine (F) belongs to Group 17 (also known as Group VII) and has 7 valence electrons.\n\nIn the reactants, we have:\n\n- 1 Xe atom with 6 valence electrons\n- 4 F atoms with 7 valence electrons each (total of 28 valence electrons)\n- 2 O atoms with 6 valence electrons each (total of 12 valence electrons)\n- 2 F atoms with 7 valence electrons each (total of 14 valence electrons)\n\nAdding up all the valence electrons, we have a total of 6 + 28 + 12 + 14 = 60 valence electrons.\n\nNow, we need to distribute these 60 valence electrons among the atoms in compound Y. Since Xe and O both have 6 valence electrons, they will form bonds with F atoms to complete their octet (8 electrons). The most likely compound formed is XeOF4, which has the following distribution of valence electrons:\n\n- 1 Xe atom with 6 valence electrons\n- 1 O atom with 6 valence electrons\n- 5 F atoms with 7 valence electrons each (total of 35 valence electrons)\n\nThe total number of valence electrons in XeOF4 is 6 + 6 + 35 = 47. However, we have 60 valence electrons to distribute. Therefore, there must be additional lone pairs of electrons in the compound.\n\nThe remaining 13 valence electrons (60 - 47) can be distributed as lone pairs on the Xe and O atoms. Since each lone pair consists of 2 electrons, we can have a maximum of 6 lone pairs on Xe (to complete its octet) and 3 lone pairs on O (to complete its octet).\n\nIn XeOF4, Xe already has 5 bonds with F atoms, so it can accommodate only 1 more lone pair (2 electrons) to complete its octet. O already has 1 bond with Xe and 1 bond with an F atom, so it can accommodate 2 more lone pairs (4 electrons) to complete its octet.\n\nThus, the total number of lone pairs in the whole molecule of Y (XeOF4) is:\n\n1 lone pair on Xe + 2 lone pairs on O = 3 lone pairs\n\nSo, the final answer is 3.00."

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate law for the reaction. The rate law is an equation that relates the rate of the reaction to the concentrations of the reactants. The general form of the rate law for this reaction is:\n\nRate = k[A]^m[B]^n[C]^p\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, [A], [B], and [C] are the concentrations of the reactants, and m, n, and p are the orders of the reaction with respect to each reactant.\n\nWe can use the data from the table to determine the values of m, n, and p. Let's start by comparing experiments 1 and 2. The concentrations of A and C are the same in both experiments, but the concentration of B is doubled in experiment 2. However, the rate of the reaction remains the same. This tells us that the reaction is zero-order with respect to B, meaning that the rate of the reaction does not depend on the concentration of B. So, n = 0.\n\nNow let's compare experiments 1 and 3. The concentrations of A and B are the same in both experiments, but the concentration of C is doubled in experiment 3. The rate of the reaction doubles as well. This tells us that the reaction is first-order with respect to C, meaning that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of C. So, p = 1.\n\nFinally, let's compare experiments 1 and 4. The concentrations of B and C are the same in both experiments, but the concentration of A is increased by a factor of 1.5 in experiment 4. The rate of the reaction increases by a factor of 1.5 as well. This tells us that the reaction is first-order with respect to A, meaning that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of A. So, m = 1.\n\nNow we know the rate law for the reaction:\n\nRate = k[A]^1[B]^0[C]^1 = k[A][C]\n\nWe can use the data from any of the experiments to determine the value of k. Let's use experiment 1:\n\n$6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ = k(0.2)(0.1)\n\nk = $3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\mathrm{dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$\n\nNow we can use the rate law and the value of k to determine the rate of the reaction for the given concentrations of A, B, and C:\n\nRate = $(3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\mathrm{dm}^{3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1})(0.15 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3})(0.15 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3})$\n\nRate = $6.75 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$\n\nSo, the value of Y is 6.75. The rate of the reaction for the given concentrations of A, B, and C is $6.75 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$."
